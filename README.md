this is a basic Login Page that I made in about a hour I started coding recently and for this I didnt use a tutorial
so thats why its so basic so if you want something more complex I think this can be scaled up but you will have to
modife the code alot so dont think this is a full on server side login page this is a ton of stuff you can use for 
that I reccomened node js if you want to start a actual login system and much more 

Also if you just want to see the build in Action you go to this link
